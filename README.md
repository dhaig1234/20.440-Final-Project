## SUGAR-seq Enables Simultaneous Detection of Glycans, Epitopes, and the Transcriptome in Single Cells



### Overview
While aberrant glycosylation is implicated and characterized in many types of cancer, the glycan landscape and the glycosylation mechanism are less understood in immune cell response to cancer. Further insight into the glycan landscape and the glycosylation mechanism of immune cells, specifically T cells, would provide an opportunity to better understand the immune system's attack on cancer cells and potential cancer therapies. This code strives to (1) investigate the mechanism of T cell glycosylation in response to tumor cells and (2) create a machine learning model to predict glycosylation in other immune cells. 

### Data 
Multi-modal single cell RNA sequencing of pooled TILs from B16-Ova and MC38-Ova tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from mus musculus.
